# BaseClient contract

Abstract base for every LLM provider client. Owns HTTP transport, request bookkeeping, the tool-call loop, and signal dispatch. Subclasses supply the wire format, message model, and continuation shape.

---

## Responsibilities

**HTTP transport.** `BaseClient` wraps `HttpClient` to issue both buffered and streaming HTTP requests. It manages the lifecycle of each streaming reply, wiring chunk and completion signals into internal handlers.

**Request bookkeeping.** Every in-flight request is tracked in a central map keyed by a unique request ID. Each entry holds the stream handle, response buffers, the original URL and payload (needed for tool continuations), a continuation counter, and the captured stop reason. This map is the single source of truth for request state.

**Tool-call loop.** When a streamed response ends with pending tool calls, `BaseClient` walks the tool-use blocks from the message, dispatches them through `ToolsManager`, collects results, and asks the provider subclass to build a continuation payload. The new payload is re-posted under the same request ID. This loop is bounded to a fixed maximum number of continuations to prevent runaways.

**Signal dispatch.** Text deltas, thinking blocks, tool start/result events, final completion, and errors are delivered as Qt signals (`chunkReceived`, `accumulatedReceived`, `thinkingBlockReceived`, `toolStarted`, `toolResultReady`, `requestCompleted`, `requestFinalized`, `requestFailed`). All signals are emitted on the `BaseClient`'s owning thread; Qt's default `AutoConnection` queues cross-thread delivery safely.

## Provider subclass contract

Each provider must supply implementations for several categories of functionality:

- **Wire format**: declare which tool schema format the provider uses, and prepare the outgoing HTTP request with the correct authentication headers and content type.
- **Streaming parser**: accept raw bytes from the HTTP stream and push them through the appropriate framer (SSE or JSON-lines), updating the provider's message object as events arrive. A separate path handles buffered (non-streamed) responses.
- **Message bookkeeping**: maintain a per-request message object (a `BaseMessage` subclass) and clean it up when the request ends.
- **Continuation**: given the original payload, the current message state, and the collected tool results, build a new JSON payload that includes the assistant's response and the tool results in the provider's wire format.
- **Error parsing** (optional): extract a human-readable error message from provider-specific HTTP error response bodies.

### Typical sendMessage pattern

```cpp
RequestID FooClient::sendMessage(
    const QJsonObject &payload, const QString &endpoint, RequestMode mode)
{
    const RequestID id = createRequest();
    const QString resolved = endpoint.isEmpty() ? QStringLiteral("/chat") : endpoint;
    m_messages.insert(id, new FooMessage(/*...*/));
    sendRequest(id, QUrl(m_url + resolved), payload, mode);
    return id;
}
```

`endpoint` lets the caller pick a non-default path on providers that
expose more than one (e.g. Mistral's `/fim/completions`). Passing an
empty string selects the provider default, so single-endpoint clients
can ignore the argument beyond the empty-check shown above.

Consumers subscribe to `BaseClient` signals (`chunkReceived`,
`requestCompleted`, `requestFinalized`, `requestFailed`, `toolStarted`,
`toolResultReady`, `thinkingBlockReceived`) to observe request progress.
All signals are emitted on the `BaseClient`'s owning thread; Qt's
`AutoConnection` handles cross-thread queued delivery.

## Error handling

Errors reach the caller through three paths:

- **Transport errors** -- DNS failures, timeouts, SSL errors, aborted connections, and connection refused. These originate from the network layer and are forwarded as failure notifications.
- **HTTP errors (4xx/5xx)** -- When non-success status headers arrive, the client switches to error mode and accumulates the response body. At stream end, the provider gets a chance to parse the vendor-specific error format. If it declines, a default message with the status code and a body snippet is used.
- **Parse/protocol errors** -- Malformed streams or unexpected JSON structures detected during provider-specific parsing. The provider reports these directly as request failures.

## Checklist: adding a new provider

1. Create a new folder under `source/clients/` with the client and message implementation files.
2. Add a public header under `include/LLMQore/`.
3. Add a tool schema format enumerator if the provider's tool definition shape differs from existing ones, and teach `ToolsManager` to produce it.
4. Implement the provider subclass contract: message sending, model listing, request preparation, stream/buffered parsing, message bookkeeping, continuation building, and optionally error parsing.
5. Add unit tests covering constructor sanity, payload shape, and any provider-specific quirks.
